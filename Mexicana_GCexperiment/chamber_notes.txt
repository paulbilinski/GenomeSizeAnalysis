 As estimates for leaf elongation rate in maize are highly variable, we investigated results from three studies on maito identify the range of possible LER prior estimates \cite{ben1995temperature,van1985inhibitory,bos2000morphological}.
 Bos et al \jri{please format} reported a 4.0cm/day LER for the 3rd leaf in similar temperature conditions, but grew plants in sandy soil with fertilizer application every other leaf emergence, or roughly every 2 weeks.
 As our experiment used soil with fertilizer application every other day, we therefore consider this the lower bound of possible LER priors.
 Ben et al \cite{ben1995temperature} used soil with regular water and fertilizer application similar to our experiment, though they measure a different leaf, and LER is known to vary through plant development.
 In estimating LER, Ben et al vary meristem temperature and report values of elongation rates of the 6th leaf from 4.32 (at 17$^{\circ}$C), 7.2 (at 21$^{\circ}$C), and 9.6 cm/day (at 26$^{\circ}$C).
 Van Volkenburgh and Boyer report a 4.6 cm/day leaf elongation rate one day after watering under a 30/20$^{\circ}$C day/night temperature regime \cite{van1985inhibitory}.
 From this range of values, we believe that the LER prior for our experiment will be approximately 4.6cm/day, with a lower bound at 4.0cm/day.
